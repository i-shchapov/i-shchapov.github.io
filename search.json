Whilst central bank balance sheet expansions are effective in stabilising the economy in a financial stress episode, they increase the frequency of such episodes and their duration. Balance sheet expansions induce financial intermediaries to take on more risk in normal times and slow their recapitalisation during a stress episode. In a tightening cycle, stabilisation properties of balance sheet policies are maintained but come at a significant cost to price stability."

Concurrently, there has been a gradual convergence in productivity between young and elderly workers. This paper aims to explore the relationship between productivity, demographic shifts, and interest rates in Japan during the post-bubble era, using an overlapping generations two-agent New Keynesian (OTANK) DSGE model. The narrowing productivity gap between younger and older cohorts puts upward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, factors such as longer life expectancy and negative population growth rates exert downward pressure on interest rates. The latter effect dominates. A central bank that does not account for this when setting monetary policy may induce deflationary pressure in the economy. Important policy implications emerge: Enhancing worker productivity across workers’ entire life-cycle and bridging the productivity gap between younger and older workers can help offset the decline in interest rates, and monetary policy ought to account for shifting demographics."

Using a New-Keynesian two-agent framework, we show that CBDCs can enhance welfare for unbanked households by providing an interest-bearing savings tool that facilitates consumption smoothing in response to monetary policy shocks. However, higher CBDC rates, while beneficial to unbanked households, reduce welfare for banked households due to tax redistribution effects. A Ramsey optimal policy exercise demonstrates that a social planner would typically set the CBDC rate to maintain a constant spread relative to the policy rate to maximise welfare. These findings emphasise the importance of tailoring CBDC design to an economy’s level of financial inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is Taxing to be CoherentDavid Murakami and Ivan ShchapovRevision requested at Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Paper PDF]\nThe presence of an occasionally binding constraint due to the effective lower bound (ELB) in New Keynesian models generally gives rise to multiple equilibria under active monetary policy. To restore uniqueness in the model with an active Taylor rule, we consider appropriate simple fiscal policy instruments. Without relaxing the assumptions of Ricardian equivalence, full information, and rational expectations, we show that appropriate fiscal targeting rules ensure that New Keynesian models subject to the ELB possess a unique solution."
